# Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/tiredofit/ruby) and 
is the recommended method of installation.


```bash
docker pull tiredofit/ruby:(imagetag)

# Quick Start

Utilize this image as a base for further builds. By default it does not start the S6 Overlay system, but 
Bash. Please visit the [s6 overlay repository](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for 
instructions on how to enable the S6 Init system when using this base or look at some of my other images 
which use this as a base.
